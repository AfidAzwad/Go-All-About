/* Since defer statements execute in LIFO (Last In, First Out) order, hereâ€™s what happens:

1. First, defer fmt.Println("File closed successfully!!") is added to the stack.
2. Then, defer file.Close() is added on top of it.

When the function exits, deferred statements execute in reverse order, meaning file.Close()
will run before fmt.Println("File closed successfully!!"). */
