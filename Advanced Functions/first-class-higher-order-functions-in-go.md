# First-Class and Higher-Order Functions in Go

## First-Class Functions in Go

Go treats functions as **first-class citizens**. This means that functions in Go can be:
1. Assigned to variables.
2. Passed as arguments to other functions.
3. Returned from other functions.
4. Stored in data structures (like slices or maps).

## Higher-Order Functions in Go

A higher-order function is a function that either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function.

For example:

- A function that takes another function as a parameter to modify or extend its behavior.
- A function that returns another function.

## Key Use Cases

- **Custom logic encapsulation:** You can pass functions as arguments to abstract common behaviors, like sorting or filtering.
- **Flexibility:** Higher-order functions make it easier to implement flexible systems where behaviors can change based on the provided function.
