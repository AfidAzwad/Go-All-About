# Creational Pattern: Builder

## Purpose:
- Encapsulates an object's construction process, specifying various parts of a complex API.
- Enables flexible creation of an object that can have many different representations.
- Increases code readability for complex types.

## Scenarios:
- Useful for objects that have complex APIs, multiple constructor options, and several different possible representations.
- Particularly helpful when the creation process involves many steps, and each step could have different configurations.

### Example Use Case:
- Suppose you're constructing an object for a report generator. The report can have various sections (e.g., header, footer, content) that may or may not be present. Using the Builder pattern, you can create different report configurations (e.g., with or without a header) while keeping the construction logic organized and flexible.

### Advantages:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps the construction code separate from the object's business logic.
- **Flexibility**: Builders allow for variations in the constructed object without modifying the core object class.
- **Step-by-Step Construction**: Allows constructing complex objects step by step, which can be crucial for large objects with many possible variations.

### Disadvantages:
- **Complexity**: Can introduce additional classes, increasing complexity, especially if overused for simpler objects.
